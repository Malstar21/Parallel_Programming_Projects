# Parallel Merge Sort
A project done for a class, using C++ with OpenMP library.
Takes in two inputs one for the size of the list, the second is the number of threads to be ran.
Random numbers will be genereated based on the size of the list that will then go through threads
to be merge sorted. 
After list is sorted the program will tell us if the list is sorted or not.
